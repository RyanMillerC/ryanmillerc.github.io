title:  "Deny Application Access in Keycloak"

{% raw %}

[Keycloak] makes Single Sign-On authentication easy thanks to OpenID Connect (OIDC).
Authorization though is a mixed bag.

Authorization for Keycloak clients is usually deferred to the client application.
Keycloak says "Hey - this user is authenticated, they're good to go!" and passes your information back to the client.

This is not ideal in some situations.
For example, OpenShift will create an account for any Keycloak user that successfully authenticates.
You can set new users to have 0 permission in OpenShift but a user will still be created in OpenShift if that user authenticates through Keycloak.

To explicitly deny users from accessing an application, I use a custom authentication flow in Keycloak.
The flow denies users on the Keycloak login screen, before they are even redirected to the application.
If the user isn't allowed to access the application, Keycloak stops the process and doesn't redirect back to the client.
Instead it shows an error indicating that the user is not authorized to access the application.

Below are step-by-step instructions to configure a custom autheitcation flow to deny users that aren't in a particular group in Keycloak.
Since Keycloak is configured through the web UI, these are manual instructions (but I included a bunch of screenshots).

These instructions use OpenShift as the application.
It's assumed that an OpenShift client has been configured in Keycloak and that OpenShift has been configured to use that client for authentication.

## Create the Role, Group, and Role Mapping

The first step is to create a role, create a group, and map those together.
It's a good idea to keep these the same name.

I used `ocp-user` for my group and role name.

### Add a New Role

* On the left side navigation bar, select *Roles*
* Add a new role

### Create a New Group

* On the left side navigation bar, select *Groups*.
* Create a new group

### Map the Group to the Role

* On the group page, select the *Role Mappings* tab
* Map the `ocp-user` group to the `ocp-user` role

## Create Users

The next step is to create users that will access OpenShift.
For this example, I created two users:

* `ryan` - Is an OpenShift user
* `logan` - Is **not** an OpenShift user

These two users will be tested to validate that Keycloak is denying users that aren't in the `ocp-users` group.

### Create an OpenShift User

* On the left side navigation bar, select *Users*
* Create a new user
* **Note the `ocp-user` group membership on this user**

### Create a Regular (Non-OpenShift) User

* On the left side navigation bar, select *Users*
* Create a new user
* **Do not add the `ocp-user` group membership on this user**

## Create an Authentication Flow

The next step is to create an authentication flow that will be executed when a user is redirected to Keycloak for authentication.
Keycloak comes with several authentication flows out of the box, but I find it easier to start from scratch instead of copying an existing flow.
Once you create an initial flow, it's ok to copy that flow for other applications.
(For example if you need to deny access to OpenShift and Vault based on two separate groups.)

### Create the OpenShift Authentication Flow

* On the left side navigation bar, select *Authentication*
* On the right, select *New*
* Name the authentication *OpenShift*

![Create a top-level authentication form](assets/2022-11-04-Deny-Application-Access-in-Keycloak/06_create_top_level_authentication_form.png)

### Add Execution Steps into the OpenShift Authentication Flow

* On the right, select *Add Sub-flow*
* Create a sub-flow named *Login* (as *Required*)
* Create a second sub-flow named *RBAC* (as *Conditional*)
* **Make sure the sub-flows are not nested. They should both be at the root level.**
* Under the *Login* sub-flow, create execution steps for:
    * Cookie (as *Alternative*)
    * Username Password Form (as *Required*)
* Under the *Check Role* sub-flow, create execution steps for:
    * Condition - User Role (as *Required*)
    * Deny Access (as *Required*)

### Configure Execution Steps

* Only two of the configuration steps added in the previous step need to be configured
* Under *Actions*, configure the existing *Condition - User Role* execution step
* Set the role to `ocp-user`

![Configure "Condition - User Role" execution step](assets/2022-11-04-Deny-Application-Access-in-Keycloak/08_condition_user_role_config.png)

* Under *Actions*, configure the existing *Deny Access* execution step
* Set the deny message to `Access Denied: User does not the the "ocp-user" role`

## Configure the Client

The last step is to configure the OpenShift client in Keycloak to use the OpenShift authentication flow created in the previous step.
Each realm in Keycloak has a default authentication flow for browsers that is used unless a client specifies an override.
Within each client, an override can be configured to use any other authentication flow.

### Set the OpenShift Client to use the OpenShift Authentication Flow

* On the left side navigation bar, select *Clients*
* Select the client configured for OpenShift
* On the *Config* tab, under *Authentication Flow Overrides*, set the *Browser Flow* to *OpenShift*.

![Set an authentication flow override for the OpenShift client](assets/2022-11-04-Deny-Application-Access-in-Keycloak/10_client_authentication_flow_override.png)

## Testing It

With everything configured, open a private browser window and navigate to the OpenShift console.
Select the Keycloak provider.
Enter the login information for the OCP user, `ryan`.

![Log in as user in ocp-users group](assets/2022-11-04-Deny-Application-Access-in-Keycloak/11_ocp_user_login.png)

They should be redirected to OpenShift and successfully log in.

![Successful login as user in ocp-users group](assets/2022-11-04-Deny-Application-Access-in-Keycloak/12_ocp_user_login_successful.png)

Open a second private browser window and navigate to the OpenShift console.
Select the Keycloak provider again.
Enter the login information for the non-OCP user, `logan`.

![Log in as user not in ocp-users group](assets/2022-11-04-Deny-Application-Access-in-Keycloak/13_non_ocp_user_login.png)

They will receive the `Access Denied` message and will not be redirected to OpenShift or logged into OpenShift.
